Hi! I'm **Ansh Goyal**, a junior studying **Biomedical Engineering** at **Johns Hopkins University**, pursuing the **3+1 BS/MSE program**.  

My interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning and healthcare**, and most of my work focuses on building models that help uncover hidden insights in patient data to improve the standard of care.  

I conduct research with the [Laboratory for Computational Intensive Care Medicine](https://lcicm.jhmi.edu/people.html) under **Dr. Robert Stevens**, where I’m working on two projects involving **deep learning for neurosurgical applications** (read more on my [projects page](/projects/)).  

I’m also currently interning at **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals**, where I’m helping automate internal reporting processes within the **Preclinical Manufacturing and Process Development** department.

<a id="longbio-button" href="#" 
   onclick="document.getElementById('longbio').style.display='block'; 
            document.getElementById('longbio-separator').style.display='block';
            this.style.opacity='0.6'; 
            this.style.pointerEvents='none'; 
            return false;">

I was born and raised in **India**, by parents who were both **PhDs in biochemistry**. We moved to the **United States in 2018** when I was in **8th grade**, and with some help from some great biology teachers, I began to shed my fascination with **astronomy** for a love of **biology** (guess it was in my DNA too...).

The real breakthrough came through an internship at the **Hillman Cancer Center Academy** as a junior, where I got to work with **Dr. Rafael Ceschin** and his amazing PhD students on a project investigating the effects of **congenital heart disease on functional connectivity in the brain**. This project was where I realized the power of **data science** to provide invaluable insights into patient health, and where the seeds for my current path were planted.

From there I knew the path for me was **biomedical engineering**, and fortunately I was lucky enough to attend **Johns Hopkins University**, which gave me the resources to apply my passion and knowledge in all sorts of ways. I was able to join [**LCICM**](https://lcicm.jhmi.edu/people.html), where I continue my **neuroscience-focused research** today, and was able to participate in a **BME Design Team**, where I got to ditch my dual-monitor setup for an engineering lab where I helped design a **space-expanding system for biceps tenodesis surgery**. I also got to improve my **software engineering skills** with **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals**, where I focus on automating their internal reporting mechanisms through an app that can pull experiment data and generate the required documentation.

While I've had some **technical experience** through my research and projects, I think my greatest strength is the **speed at which I'm able to pick up new skills and adapt to new situations**. If I don't know something (so most things...), I'm always willing to learn and improve on it, and am able to do so quite fast. I also enjoy **working in and leading teams** and am adept at **communicating with people** (some neat skills I picked up through four invigorating and arduous years as a **high school debater**).

If you've read this far (which I suspect maybe 3 people have), you know where I've been. As for where I'm going, I'm not so sure either. I'm still working on that. If you're a recruiter or PI reading this, maybe you could help me figure it out! What I do know is that I want to keep solving problems, learning things, and helping people. After all, *when you help someone, you help everyone...*
