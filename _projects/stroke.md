## Clinical Background


Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) occurs when blood flow to part of the brain is obstructed, causing rapid neuronal death and lasting neurological damage. It remains a leading cause of disability and the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Early and accurate detection is critical for enabling time-sensitive interventions such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy. 

Non-contrast CT (NCCT) is the first-line imaging modality for stroke evaluation because it is fast and widely available, but ischemic lesions often appear subtle and can be missed. Usually, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1859855" target="_blank" style="color:var(--global-theme-color); text-decoration:none;">MRI is considered far superior to CT imaging for stroke detection</a>, but the increased time and resource cost accompanied by MRI imaging leads to delays in patient care.

## Project Overview


This work focuses on developing an end-to-end deep learning framework for **stroke classification** and **lesion segmentation** on NCCT scans. The classification models determine the presence of stroke, while the segmentation models highlight the affected brain regions. Together, these systems aim to improve diagnostic efficiency, reduce inter-observer variability, and provide interpretable AI-assisted insights for clinicians.

The project builds on a large-scale, curated dataset of paired CT and MRI scans, and leverages modern architectures such as ResNet, Vision Transformers, and 3D U-Net variants. The broader goal is to evaluate how far NCCT alone can be pushed as a tool for rapid, automated stroke assessment without reliance on more advanced imaging modalities.

## Current Stage


Our models have achieved strong performance in both stroke detection and lesion localization. We are currently in the **manuscript preparation stage**, finalizing experiments, writing, and compiling results for journal submission.
