## Clinical Background

**Biceps tendonitis** is a painful inflammatory condition of the long head of the biceps tendon, often affecting athletes and older adults. In severe cases, surgical intervention known as **biceps tenodesis** is required, where the damaged tendon is detached and reattached to the humerus.

Two major surgical methods exist: **open biceps tenodesis (OBT)** and **arthroscopic biceps tenodesis (ABT)**.  
While ABT offers reduced post-operative pain and faster recovery, many surgeons still prefer OBT due to the **tight subdeltoid space** that restricts visualization and tool maneuverability during arthroscopic procedures. This limitation makes key steps—particularly **suture passing and tendon fixation**—technically demanding and time-consuming.

## Project Overview

The **Tenopedics Team** designed a novel **expander cannula** that uses guided balloon inflation to temporarily enlarge the subdeltoid surgical space during ABT. This device improves visualization and maneuverability while maintaining compatibility with existing surgical workflows.

Unlike traditional cannulas, which rely on surgeon-applied tension to widen the workspace, the expander cannula actively and safely **holds the space open**, freeing both of the surgeon’s hands for precise instrument control.

## Design and Testing

The expander cannula was engineered to meet key surgical and ergonomic requirements derived from orthopedic surgeon feedback across Johns Hopkins, UMD, and MGH.  
Two transparent **polyurethane balloons** are guided through curved side channels of the cannula and inflated with saline, expanding the working space by up to **20 mm** without obstructing tool movement or the arthroscope’s field of view.

## Results and Impact

- **Force tolerance:** Sustained >20 N without deformation when filled with saline.
- **Space expansion:** Increased visible surgical field area by ~900%.
- **Ease of use:** Reduced surgeon workload and procedure time during the critical suture-passing phase.

By improving visualization and maneuverability, this device aims to **reduce the learning curve for arthroscopic biceps tenodesis**, encouraging wider adoption of minimally invasive techniques and improving patient outcomes.
